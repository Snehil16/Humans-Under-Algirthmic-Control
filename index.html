          <p class="hometext" data-aos="fade-up">Algorithms are essentially sets of instructions used in computer programming to solve issues and carry out tasks.
            Algorithms were mathematical formulas long before there were computers.<br>
            On what algorithms do and how they impact us, much has been written. This includes the covert ways in which algorithms rule us, the content that they allow or prohibit from appearing in our social media feeds, and the countless numbers
            of calculated decisions that are made every day.</p>

          <h2 class="header2" data-aos="fade-up">How Facebook controls you? </h2>
          <p class="hometext"> Nothing on Earth has the power of Mark Zuckerberg's algorithm, not even China's Social Credit system. Facebook is accessed by almost 2 billion users daily. The majority of them enable posts to be shown to them in the
            sequence that the algorithm thinks would keep them interested. As a result, regardless of how close you are to your friends in real life, you see a lot more postings from them. Additionally, information that sparks heated debates gets
            promoted to the top. Zuckerberg is aware of this. </p>

      <div id="heading3" class="content">
        <div class="text">
          <h2 class="header2" data-aos="fade-up">What about Youtube?</h2>
          <p class="hometext" data-aos="fade-up">Facebook's propensity for contentious postings may harm democracy less than YouTube's "watch next" algorithm. The algorithm used by the service, which is designed to force you to view more YouTube videos and
            advertisements regardless of the circumstances, suggested almost 70% of the YouTube videos we watch.</p>
          <p class="hometext" data-aos="fade-up">Accordingly, YouTube promotes material that is controversial since viewers will stick around whether they like it or not. Additionally, the algorithm will presume that you are interested in controversial material once
            you have seen one piece of it, directing you to the content that viewers of that video choose to watch next. That explains how your parents may start by watching a single, very innocent Fox News video and wind up delving into QAnon
            conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p class="hometext" data-aos="fade-up">Your academic plans might be made or broken by admission algorithms. According to a Washington Post study, 44 institutions assign applicants a score out of 100 using prediction algorithms. The evaluation of a student's
            application takes into account a variety of factors, including test results, residential address, transcripts, and even the websites they've visited. All of that information is analyzed to determine how well a student fits a certain
            school.</p>
          <p class="hometext" data-aos="fade-up">These public and private universities (working with outside consulting firms) also try to predict if a student will enroll if admitted, so your interest and perceived compatibility with the campus is also calculated.
            That calculation sometimes happens even before you apply so likely candidates can be targeted.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <h2 class="header2" data-aos="fade-up">Who calculates students' grades? </h2>
          <p class="hometext" data-aos="fade-up">Since students couldn't take the examinations that would determine their chances of getting into university during pandemic shutdowns, the education department first opted to utilize an algorithm to give scores. This
            decision sparked protests from students in the UK. Students were aware that computers rather than people were determining their grades based on prior achievement.</p>
          <p class="hometext" data-aos="fade-up">The International Baccalaureate program this year handed the robots grading authority because to a similar circumstance. According to Wired, because the final test was unable to take place, the software developed an
            algorithm to forecast how students would have performed based on grades and assignments from earlier in the year as well as grades from previous students from the same institutions.</p>
